# VolleyballGame
Inspired by the idea of a beach ball skin for League of Legends' Orianna, I tried making a little volleyball game. 

Two players must play. One player uses the 'a' and 'd' keys to move and the 's' key to hit the ball. The other uses the arrow keys in the same manner.

The code was lazily forked from my Galager game.

Development was circa September 2013. Used SDL 1 for input, graphics and sound.
